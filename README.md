# A chat app for Sleeper.app

This is a sample chat web app built using React, Typescript, and CSS. No distributed database is in use on this iteration, instead we rely on `sessionStorage` to authenticate users and `localStorage` to store everything else.

# Sample users and data

There are some sample users that are created  at runtime, which came from me.
These users iterate through some sample text which was taken from an interview with [Thom Yorke](https://highprofiles.info/interview/thom-yorke/) and [Brian Eno](https://highprofiles.info/interview/brian-eno/)
